## Imaris plugins

Updated the original implementation by Sarun Gulyanon 28 July 2018.
Based on the **Breadth-first search (BFS)** - algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored.

**Required** : Need `ImarisXT` license and `Imarisbridge`

1. `swc_exporter.py`- Export any Imaris filaments as swc morphology- separate and in a single combined file.
2. `swc_importer.py` - Import any swc morphology as Imaris filaments.
